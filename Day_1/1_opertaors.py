# Like any other programming languagepyhron also has its set of operators
# Operators are the symbols to carryout mathematical and logical operations
# Operators in pyhthon are:
#1 Arthematic operators
#2 Logical Operators
#3 Relational / Comparison Opertors
#4 Assignment Operators
#5 Membership Operators
#6 Identity Operators
##### Arthematic Operators
## Addition (+)
a=1
b=2
print{a+b} #3

Substraction (+)
a=5
b=2
print{a-b} #3

Multiplication (*)
a=5
b=2
print{a*b}

Division (/)
a=4
b=2
print{a/b}

Raise to power(**)
a=2
print{a**3} #8

Remainder/Modulus (%)
a=4
b=5
print {a%2} # 0
print {b%2} # 1

Floor Division (//)
a=2
print {a/2} # 1.5
print {a//2} #1

a=-3
print {a/2} # -1.5
print {a//2} # -2

Relational Operators
# >, <, ==, >=, <=, !=
#results of relational operations are true are false
a = 5
b = 2
print (a>b)  # true
print (b<a)  # false
print (a = b)  # false
print (a !=b)  #true

###  Logical Operators
#  And, or, not are logical operators
# The results of logical operators are also True/False
a = 5
b = 3
c = 5
print {a==c or a==b} #true
print {a==c and a==c} # false
print {a!=c or a==b} # false
print {a==c and a!+=b} # true

a= true
print{not a} # false

a = 5
print{not a} #false

### Assignment Operator
# "=" is the basic assignment operator
institute = Broadway # here = is the assignment operator
a = 1
print(a) #1
a a+1
print(a) #2
a+=1 #a = a+1
pri
a=5
a*=2
print (a) # 10

### Membership Operator
# 'in' and "not in'
# the result of membership operation is also True/False
print (2 in[1,2,3]) #True
print(3 not in [1,2,3]) #False
